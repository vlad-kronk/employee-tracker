## Description

As a University of Washington Web Development bootcamp student, I want to work towards mastery of manipulating data in SQL databases using a JavaScript environment. This project helped me further my understanding of the flow between the client and the server and how to properly manage all the information in that flow. This project is a fully customizable team management application. View, add, or change employees, roles, and departments on the fly with a easy-to-use Inquirer console interface.

## Installation

Run 'npm i' in the root directory.

## Usage

Before use, add a .env file with the same information as the .env.EXAMPLE file in the root. This will allow you to connect to your own database. After this, using any mysql interface, navigate to the /db directory and run 'source schema.sql;'. This will set up the tables in your personal database. Back in the console and in the root directory, run 'node app.js' to start the application.
